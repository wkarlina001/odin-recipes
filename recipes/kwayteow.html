        <h3>How to make the best kway teow at home</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large non stick skillet over high heat.</li>
            <li>When heated, add shrimp and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until just cooked through, then remove into bowl</li>
            <li>Add Chinese sausage and fish cake, and cook for 1 minute until sausage is caramelised, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp oil then add egg and cook, pushing in the edges to make a thick omelette. Once set, chop it up roughly using a wooden spoon (see video), then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add bean sprouts and cook for about 1 minute until just starting to wilt, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add lard. Once melted and starting to smoke, add garlic then immediately add noodles. Fold gently 4 times using a spatula + wooden spoon (see video) just to disperse oil through noodles.</li>
            <li>Tip all the other ingredients back in plus the chives. Fold gently twice, then pour all the Sauce over.</li>
            <li>Gently toss 4 to 6 times to disperse the sauce, pausing in between to allow the noodles to have a chance to caramelise on the edges a bit.</li>
            <li>Remove from stove and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
